## Data Analysis
Here, we'll analyse the data related to subsidence incidents in Florida. We'll explore various attributes and trends to gain insights into the occurrence of subsidence.

### Data Cleaning
We'll start by cleaning the data to prepare it for analysis. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and removing duplicates.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Next, we'll perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of subsidence incidents. This may involve summary statistics, frequency analysis, and correlation analysis.

## Visualisation
In this section, we'll create visualisations to represent the data in a meaningful way. We'll use libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create interactive and informative plots.

### Geographic Analysis
We'll visualise the geographic distribution of subsidence incidents using maps. This will help us identify hotspots and patterns of subsidence across Florida.

### Temporal Analysis
We'll also analyse the temporal trends of subsidence incidents over time. This involves time series analysis and trend visualisation.

## Conclusion
Finally, we'll summarise our findings and conclusions from the analysis. We'll discuss key insights, implications, and potential areas for further research.

- **Spatial Distribution**: The spatial distribution of subsidence incidents across Florida indicates areas of higher and lower susceptibility to subsidence. Hotspots of incidents may correlate with factors such as geological composition, land use, or groundwater extraction.

- **Temporal Trends**: Analysing the temporal trends of subsidence incidents over time can reveal patterns and potential contributing factors. Identifying any significant increases or decreases in incidents over specific periods may prompt further investigation into underlying causes.

## How to Use
To run the analysis and visualise your data, follow these steps:
- Clone or download the repository.
-  Install the required dependencies if required.
-  Open the Jupyter Notebook `Florida_Subsidence_Incident_Report.ipynb`.
-  Run the code cells to execute the analysis and generate visualisations.
